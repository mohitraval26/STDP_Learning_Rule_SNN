In the project demonstration, the functionality and effectiveness of the developed Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule are showcased. Furthermore, the comparison with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) highlights the computational efficiency and biological realism achieved by the SNN-STDP model. 
The weight changes observed are as follows:
